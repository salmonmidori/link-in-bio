       The URLs of your social media profiles. I used my GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter profiles.

A list of URLs that you want to share. I used a handful of essays and short stories that I find myself sharing with people often. Here are some examples that you can peruse for inspiration.

A thumbnail image for each link. I used a few strategies to find an image for each of my links:

Searched Unsplash for a relevant image.

Generated an image with AI. Dezgo is an option that doesn’t require an account. ChatGPT and Gemini require that you sign up for an account.


A website might have a specific image that it wants you to use when sharing it. If so, it will have a <meta> tag with the attribute property="og:image" within its <head>.

You could View Source on the page to try and find such a meta tag yourself; or you can use the OpenGraph tool, which extracts the relevant meta tag if it’s there. -->
